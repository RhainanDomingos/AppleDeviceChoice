# 📱 Apple Device Choice

**Apple Device Choice** is a basic app I built to reinforce navigation and UI flow using UIKit and ViewCode.  
The user starts on a Home screen and navigates through device choices (MacBook or iMac). Each selection takes the user to a new screen displaying an image, a label, and a button to return.
